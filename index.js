 *  For an Earth-size planet orbiting a Sun-like star, this limit corresponds
 * to an Seff of about 1.11. The Seff corresponding to this inner limit of the HZ
 * would be slightly higher for planets more massive than the Earth and slightly
 * lower for stars cooler than the Sun.
 *
 * The outer limit of the HZ, as defined by Kopparapu et al., corresponds to the
 * maximum greenhouse limit beyond which a CO2-dominated greenhouse is incapable
 * of maintaining a planetâ€™s surface temperature. The latest work suggests an
 * Seff value of about 0.36 for a Sun-like star with cooler stars having slightly
 * lower values. As with the inner limit of the HZ, there are some slightly more
 * optimistic definitions of the outer edge of the HZ such as the early-Mars scenario
 * or evoking some sort of super-greenhouse where gases other than just CO2 contribute
 * to warming a planet. But these more optimistic definitions do not change the Seff
 * for the outer limit of the HZ significantly.

 * A series of analyses of Kepler data and follow-up observations published over the
 * last year have shown that there are limits on how large a rocky planet can become
 * before it starts to possess increasingly large amounts of water, hydrogen and helium
 * as well as other volatiles making the planet a Neptune-like world with no real
 * prospect of being habitable. Work performed by Leslie Rogers
 * (a Hubble Fellow at the California Institute of Technology)
 * has shown that planets with radii greater than no more than 1.6 times that of the Earth
 * (or RE) are most likely mini-Neptunes. This and other recent work suggests that this
 * transition corresponds to planets with masses greater than about 4 to 6 times that of the
 * Earth (or ME). As a result, planets larger or more massive than these
 * empirically-derived thresholds are unlikely to be rocky planets never mind habitable.
